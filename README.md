# AustralisFox
An Australis theme for modern Firefox.

This theme is unfinished, as I lost interest in it. There are some bugs, but it's mostly usable.

# Requirements:

Compact Mode must be enabled (go to about:config -> search for "browser.uidensity" -> set it to "1")

# Recommended stuff to do:

Setting "svg.context-properties.content.enabled" to "true" in about:config (for the colorization of some icons)

Installing the "Australis-like refresh in URL bar" extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/australis-refresh-in-url-bar/
